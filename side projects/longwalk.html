            <p><strong>The Long Walk</strong> is based on the Stephen King novel, it follows 50 young men who embark on a yearly walk to see who is left standing, only one makes it and the rules can be quite gruelling, I went into this movie not expecting much but I left feeling WOW.</p>
            <p>Let me tell you, movies rarely give me any type of experience, if it does its one of dissapointment, but this movie was engaging fron start to finish, the characters, the emotions, the dialgue and the reactions from the charcters made me feel like i was treading the cement with them.</p>
            <p>This is on par with Sinners and I frankly enjoyed this movie way more than Sinners, will definitely be watching it again, this shit made me cry on the way home, the soundtrack was phenomenal, every song taking you deep within the depths of your own soul.</p>

        <h2>Closing Statement</h2>
        <p>In my final words, I just wanna appreciate times like this when a movie comes along and just rocks my shit, very rare but when it happens its like, yes....Cause I'm a firm believer that movies are supposed to be an experience for the watcher, if you don't feel anything at all then fuck whats the point? The Long Walk was a banger and I'd definitely reccomend it to my mom, brother, uncle and cat</p>
